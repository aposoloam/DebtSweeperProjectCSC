## Guide to using DebtSweeper
DebtSweeper is a very intuitive program, and most of it's functionality is very straighforward.

## Logging In
To log in, you must either use previously registered credentials, or register with a new set

The system will not let you register the same name twice, so don't worry about that

## After Logging In
Following login, you will be greeted with a page to enter information for a new debt

The program should make sure your data is in the correct format, but just to be safe please keep in mind what values are commonly associated with certain things (I.E. don't try and put letters for a payment amount)

This program is meant to be used in a long-term manner, so all debt information is based on yearly amounts adjusted for the inputted interest rate

## Payments
After you've entered in a debt, you can view it and also input payments. 

Using the income tool, input a monthly amount you are willing to contribute, and the program will display a calculation of how long each debt will take to pay off.

You can also input payments, and the program will save the data and adjust your debts accordingly. 

## Exiting
After you're done using the tool, don't forget to logout :)
